This folder contains a toy example to run PP-GWAS locally (no MKL dependencies) on a small-scale dataset. Please refer to **sample_notebook.ipynb**.

## Requirements

### Conda Environment
The notebook script requires a Conda environment to run. Use the **environment.yml** file to install the required environment. 

Ensure the `ppgwas.sh` script is executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ppgwas.sh
```
