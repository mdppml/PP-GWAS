# PP-GWAS: Privacy Preserving Multi-Site Genome-wide Association Studies

This repository is associated with the paper titled **"PP-GWAS: Privacy Preserving Multi-Site Genome-wide Association Studies"**. It provides all the necessary code to reproduce the experiments described in the paper, including synthetic dataset generation, dataset loading, distributed computations, and experiment results.

## Repository Structure

- **Datasets Folders**: 
  - **Code**: Contains all relevant code to implementing PP-GWAS. 
  - **Data_Generation**: This folder includes the code used for generating synthetic data using the pysnptools library. 
  - **REGENIE**: Contains details on how one can restructure synthetic data to fit the formats supported by REGENIE. It also includes instructions on how to run REGENIE on the data.
  - **Results**: This folder holds all output .txt files generated from the experiments reported in the paper.
    
  - **test_site**: A testing site to run the code for data generation and PP-GWAS.
